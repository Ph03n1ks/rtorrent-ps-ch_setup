### Connect via SSH

[JuiceSSH](https://juicessh.com) is a really easily configurable and usable SSH client with `tmux`. Although it has some rendering bugs regarding to Unicode characters, as we can see below, it's still amazing.

The following settings under `Settings` are suggested for the session:
* set "Theme / Colours" to `Solarized Dark`
* set "Font size" to `9`
* set "Horizontal Swipe" to `Screen next/prev window` (since our `tmux` config has rebinded keys)
* enable "UTF-8" support
* set "Emulator Type" to `xterm-256color`

Set up new connections under `Connections`:
* create new identity under `Identities` tab (it has to be transported to the Ubuntu machine)
* create new connection under `Connections` tab for external use
   * set "Nickname", "Address", "Port"
   * select the previously generated identity for "Identity"
* duplicate the previously created connection under `Connections` tab for internal use
   * modify "Nickname", "Address", "Port"


### Connect via FTP

[FTP Express](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zifero.ftpclient) ([homepage](https://www.zifero.com/apps/ftp-express/)) is the only FTP client (that I've tried) that actually can authenticate over `TLS` (many FTP client apps state that they can :) ).

Set up new connection under `Sites` tab using `+` sign:
* set "Name", "Host", "Port"
* select `FTPS explicit` for "Protocol"
* set "User", "Password"
* set "Remote" to `/Torrents/.rtorrent/.queue` (to be able to easily transfer files into one of the category directories of queue directory)
* x "Passive Mode"
* select `UTF-8` for "Character Encoding"

You can duplicate the previously created connection if you like for internal use:
* modify "Name", "Host", "Port"


### Connect to Samba share

[X-plore File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lonelycatgames.Xplore&hl=en_US) can be used for accessing `Samba shares` within our local network as well. Once it accessed to a share then a selected file can be `Open with` by any application (it has a role as a middle layer).

`Add a new server` under `LAN` at the left side of the app:
* set a "Label" (display name)
* set "Server" to "ip", e.g. `192.168.1.8`
* set "Path" to "sharename", e.g. `wd3`
* set "Username", "Password"
* enable `SMB v2`

That's it, it should work. If not and you are sure that it should (e.g. there's no firewall blocking, etc.) then ping the IP of the Ubuntu machine from a terminal app (I'm not kidding :) ) and try to connect to it again.
